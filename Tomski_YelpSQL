Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

In this part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

Inferences and Analysis:

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

They have equal distributions. With what I chose to evaluate, there is one 2-3 star and one 4-5 star restaurant for both a restaurant open for 12 hours on Saturday, and a restaurant open for 4 to 5 hours on a Saturday, where the 5 hour long open one is for dinner (4-5 star) and the 4 hour long one is for brunch (2-3 stars). It make sense to me that the brunch is the 2-3 star since they focus on breakfast food for mainly families and people who are drinking. The 4-5 star dinner restaurant is going to be more critical I would believe on how they plate their food and present themselves. Just an observation.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

It depends to be honest. They all have different number of reviews, with the solo dinner place only having 89 reviews as a 4-5 star (the most), and the solo only brunch place having 34 reviews (the second most) The two restaurants that are open for lunch and dinner (so 12 hours), and that are both a 2-3 star restaurant and a 4-5 star restaurant, both have less than 10 reviews. So it seems that the restaurants that specialize in a certain type of entree (i.e., brunch version dinner) get more reviews.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No because they are all different postal codes, and I am not familiar with the Toronto area, and what exactly those locations represent ethnicity wise, and type of clusters. I know Toronto is highly diverse though, so those different locations and the type of restaurant could be geared towards the type of cultures that reside nearby.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.name AS BusinessName
    ,  business.review_count AS NumReviews
    ,  hours.hours AS WorkHours
    ,  business.postal_code AS Location
    ,  CASE
        WHEN (business.stars >= 2) AND (business.stars <= 3) THEN '2-3 stars'
        WHEN (business.stars >= 4) AND (business.stars <= 5) THEN '4-5 stars'
       END AS NumOfStars

FROM business JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id JOIN category ON category.business_id = business.id
WHERE ((business.city LIKE '%Toronto%') AND (category.category LIKE '%Restaurants%')) AND (((business.stars >= 2) AND (business.stars <= 3)) OR ((business.stars >= 4) AND (business.stars <= 5)))
GROUP BY stars
ORDER BY NumOfStars ASC

+---------------+------------+----------------------+----------+------------+
| BusinessName  | NumReviews | WorkHours            | Location | NumOfStars |
+---------------+------------+----------------------+----------+------------+
| 99 Cent Sushi |          5 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 | M5B 2E5  | 2-3 stars  |
| Pizzaiolo     |         34 | Saturday|10:00-4:00  | M5H 1X6  | 2-3 stars  |
| Edulis        |         89 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 | M5V      | 4-5 stars  |
| Sushi Osaka   |          8 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 | M9A 1C2  | 4-5 stars  |
+---------------+------------+----------------------+----------+------------+



2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

i. Difference 1:

The businesses with more reviews tend to stay open given the avg number of reviews being apx 8.6 value points higher than the businesses that closed.

ii. Difference 2:

Despite the number only being slightly higher, it is evident that businesses with higher start rating on average stay open (i.e., val = apx 3.68) than those who have closed (i.e., val = apx 3.52).

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(business.id)) AS NumOfClosedOrOpenedBusinesses
    ,  AVG(business.review_count)   AS AVGNumReview
    ,  SUM(business.review_count)   AS TotalNumReview
    ,  AVG(business.stars)          AS AVGStarRating
    ,  CASE
        WHEN business.is_open == 0 THEN 'Closed'
        WHEN business.is_open == 1 THEN 'Opened'
       END AS BusinessIsOpen
FROM business
GROUP BY BusinessIsOpen

+-------------------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------+----------------+
| NumOfClosedOrOpenedBusinesses |  AVGNumReview | TotalNumReview | AVGStarRating | BusinessIsOpen |
+-------------------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------+----------------+
|                          1520 | 23.1980263158 |          35261 | 3.52039473684 | Closed         |
|                          8480 | 31.7570754717 |         269300 | 3.67900943396 | Opened         |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Predicting whether a the number of reviews along with a restaurant location will ultimately lead to one being closed or not.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will need data similar to that of the above two problems. I will need this data because I can look into a restaurant in a certain geographical area on how they are doing with the number of reviews obtained. Given the general understanding of populated or touristy one location will be can indicate how many reviews on should expect. Plus, having the work hours can tell me what type of meals they are serving (i.e., breakfast/brunch, lunch, dinner, and or just cocktails or such). So understanding that can also help with my analysis.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
